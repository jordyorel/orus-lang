| Control Flow | 45 | Very Good |
| VM Optimization | 185 | Good |

## üîç Monitoring & CI Integration

### GitHub Actions
- **Workflow**: `.github/workflows/performance.yml`
- **Triggers**: Push to main/develop, PRs, nightly schedule
- **Features**: Automated testing, performance comparison, regression alerts

### Pre-commit Hooks
- **Hook**: `hooks/pre-commit`
- **Purpose**: Catch performance regressions before commit
- **Thresholds**: Warning at 15%, failure at 50% degradation

### Results Logging
- **Log file**: `performance_results.log`
- **Format**: CSV with timestamp, commit, benchmark, measured time, baseline, status
- **Retention**: Historical data for trend analysis

## üåç Environment Considerations

### CI Environment Variance
GitHub Actions runners may show 20-40% performance variance due to:
- Shared compute resources
- Different CPU architectures
- Network latency variations
- System load fluctuations

**‚≠ê NEW: Linux Optimizations Reduce Variance to 5-15%**

### Local vs CI Performance
Baselines are adjusted for CI environments. Local development may show better performance due to:
- Dedicated resources
- Optimized local builds
- Consistent hardware
- Lower system overhead

### Linux-Specific Optimizations
The testing scripts now include Linux-specific optimizations:
- **High-precision timing**: Uses `/proc/uptime` for nanosecond accuracy
- **Multi-sample median**: 3 measurements per test, uses median for reliability
- **System optimization**: CPU governor, memory management, I/O scheduling
- **Extended warmup**: Reduces cold start effects and system noise
- **Environment tuning**: Optimized malloc, locale, and debug settings

**Improvement**: 2-3x more consistent measurements on Linux systems

## üéØ Cold Start Optimization Details

The Orus VM implements several optimizations to minimize cold start penalty:

1. **Global Dispatch Table**: Initialized once per process, not per execution
2. **Computed Goto**: Direct label jumps for maximum dispatch speed
3. **Hot Opcode Ordering**: Most frequent operations placed first in dispatch table
4. **Typed Register Optimization**: Bypasses value boxing for performance-critical paths

### Before vs After Optimization
- **Before**: 70-115x cold start penalty (1820ms vs 26ms)
- **After**: 1.02x cold start penalty (2.4% slower)
- **Improvement**: 99.7% reduction in cold start overhead

## üìù Usage Examples

### Running Performance Tests
```bash
# Quick regression check
./performance_regression_test.sh

# Detailed analysis
./precise_benchmark.sh

# Cross-language comparison
./run_all_benchmarks.sh

# Optimized CI testing (Linux)
sudo ./optimize_for_ci.sh
source /tmp/performance_env.sh
./performance_regression_test.sh
```

### Interpreting Results
- **Status 0**: Performance within acceptable range (PASS)
- **Status 1**: Minor regression detected (WARNING)
- **Status 2**: Critical regression detected (FAIL)

### Updating Baselines
Baselines automatically update when performance improves. To manually reset:
```bash
# Edit performance_baselines.txt
# Set new baseline values
# Commit changes
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Performance Regression Detected
1. Check recent commits for performance-impacting changes
2. Run `./precise_benchmark.sh` for detailed analysis
3. Compare with historical data in `performance_results.log`
4. Investigate using profiling tools if needed
5. **NEW**: Use Linux optimizations for more accurate measurements

### Test Failures
1. Ensure Orus binary is built: `make clean && make`
2. Verify benchmark files exist and are executable
3. Check system resources and load
4. Review error messages in script output
5. **NEW**: Try `./optimize_for_ci.sh` for system-level improvements

### CI Environment Issues
1. Check GitHub Actions logs for detailed error information
2. Verify baselines are appropriate for CI environment
3. Consider increasing thresholds for unstable CI performance
4. Review artifact uploads for performance data
5. **NEW**: Ensure CI optimization script runs successfully
6. **NEW**: Check performance environment variables are loaded
