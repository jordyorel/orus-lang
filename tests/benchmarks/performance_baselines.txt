# Orus Performance Baselines (in milliseconds)
# Updated after cold start optimization and global dispatch table implementation
# Format: benchmark_name=baseline_time_ms

# Core VM benchmarks - optimized with global dispatch table
# Updated for CI environment compatibility (Linux vs macOS differences)
arithmetic=19
control_flow=38
vm_optimization=126

# Performance targets (adjusted for CI environments):
# - Excellent: ≤30ms
# - Very Good: ≤60ms  
# - Good: ≤150ms
# - Fair: ≤500ms

# Cold start penalty should be minimal (< 1.5x) due to global dispatch optimization
# Note: CI environments may show 20-40% variance due to shared resources
