// Test compile-time infinite loop detection

// Test 1: Loop with false condition (should be optimized out)
while false:
    print("This should never execute")

// Test 2: Loop with break statement (should not be infinite)
while true:
    print("This has a break")
    break

// Test 3: Simple for loops that should work
for i in 0..5:
    print(i)

// Test 4: Range with step
for i in 0..10..2:
    print(i)
