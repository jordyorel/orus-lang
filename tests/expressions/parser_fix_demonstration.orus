// DEMONSTRATION: Parser fix for parenthesized cast chains
// This test demonstrates the specific user request is now working

// a: i32 = 10

// // âœ… SUCCESS: This is now ALLOWED (user's specific request)
// result: string = ((a as bool) as string)
// print("SUCCESS: Parser now allows: ((a as bool) as string)")

// // âœ… SUCCESS: More complex parenthesized chains are also allowed
// result2: i32 = (((a as bool) as string) as i32)  
// print("SUCCESS: Complex parenthesized chains work too")

// // âœ… SUCCESS: Single parenthesized casts work
// result3: bool = (a as bool)
// print("SUCCESS: Single parenthesized casts work")

// print("ðŸŽ‰ PARSER FIX COMPLETE: Parenthesized cast chains now work! ðŸŽ‰")
