// Test: Complex mixed operations with multiple type errors
// Expected: Should show friendly error for the first type mismatch

a: i32 = 10
b: f64 = 3.14
c: string = "hello"

// This should trigger mixed arithmetic error
result1 = a + b
print(result1)

// This would also be an error if reached
result2 = a + c
print(result2)
