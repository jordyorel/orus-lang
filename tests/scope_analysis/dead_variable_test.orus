// Dead Variable Elimination Test
// Tests for identifying and eliminating dead variables in complex scope hierarchies

// Test 1: Simple dead variable (declared but never used)
mut dead_simple = 42

// Test 2: Write-only variable (assigned but never read)
mut write_only = 0

for i in 0..3:
    mut loop_local = i * 2
    mut another_dead = loop_local + 100
    print("Loop value:", loop_local)

// Test 4: Dead variables in nested scopes

    mut dead_in_loop = 999
    mut used_in_loop = i * outer_used
