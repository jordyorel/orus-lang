// Phase 5: Valid casting tests
// All these casts should work correctly

// Basic numeric casts
a: i32 = 10
b = a as i64
print(b)

c: i64 = 100i64
d = c as i32
print(d)

// Floating point casts
e: f64 = 3.14
f = e as i32
print(f)

g: i32 = 42
h = g as f64
print(h)

// Unsigned type casts
i: u32 = 50u32
j = i as i32
print(j)

k: i32 = 25
l = k as u32
print(l)

// Boolean casts
m: bool = true
n = m as i32
print(n)

o: i32 = 0
p = o as bool
print(p)

q: i32 = 1
r = q as bool
print(r)

// Complex chain with explicit annotations
s: i32 = 123
t = s as f64
u = t as i64
v = u as bool
print(v)
