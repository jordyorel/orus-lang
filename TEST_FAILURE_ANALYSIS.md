# Test Failure Analysis

The `make test` suite was failing because the REPL began treating any single
word at the start of a line as a command even when the user did not type the
optional `:` prefix. Several smoke tests exercise the REPL by loading Orus
programs that legitimately bind identifiers such as `exit`, `clear`, or
`memory`. When the command parser consumed those inputs as commands it aborted
the execution path with usage errors (for example, reporting "Command 'exit'
does not take arguments") instead of evaluating the Orus code. That diverted
the harness away from the code paths the tests expect, producing mismatched
results and halting the benchmark programs.

Restoring the explicit prefix check in `process_command` fixes the issue by
returning `false` for bare identifiers so the interpreter runs them as Orus
code again. With the command dispatch gated behind `had_prefix`, the smoke and
benchmark tests regain the behaviour they had on the main branch and the suite
returns to green.
