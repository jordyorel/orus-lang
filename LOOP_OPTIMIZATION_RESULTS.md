## Loop Optimization Features Implemented

### âœ… Automatic Loop Unrolling
- **Small loops (1-8 iterations)**: Automatically unrolled at compile time
- **Single iteration loops**: Fully inlined
- **Step loops**: Optimized for constant step values
- **Safety checks**: Loops with break/continue are never unrolled

### âœ… Optimization Framework
- **Constant range analysis**: Detects compile-time constant loops
- **Iteration count calculation**: Accurately computes loop iterations
- **Variable substitution**: Correctly handles loop variable references
- **Edge case handling**: Supports negative steps and empty ranges

### âœ… Performance Characteristics
- **Zero overhead**: Optimization adds no runtime cost
- **Single-pass**: Maintains fast compilation speed
- **Conservative**: Only applies safe optimizations
- **Measurable impact**: Provides real-world performance improvements

## Technical Implementation

### Loop Unrolling Strategy
```orus
// Original loop
for i in 1..4:
    mut x = i * 2
    mut y = x + 1
    mut z = y * 3

// Automatically unrolled to:
// i = 1: x = 2, y = 3, z = 9
// i = 2: x = 4, y = 5, z = 15
// i = 3: x = 6, y = 7, z = 21
// i = 4: x = 8, y = 9, z = 27
```

### Optimization Criteria
- **Iteration count â‰¤ 8**: Eligible for unrolling
- **Constant bounds**: Start, end, and step must be compile-time constants
- **No control flow**: Loops with break/continue are excluded
- **Safe variable substitution**: Loop variables correctly replaced with constants

## Comparison with Manual Optimization

### Other Languages (Manual Optimization)
```python
# Python manual unrolling
for outer in range(1, 1001):
    x = 1 * 2; y = x + 1; z = y * 3
    x = 2 * 2; y = x + 1; z = y * 3
    x = 3 * 2; y = x + 1; z = y * 3
    x = 4 * 2; y = x + 1; z = y * 3
```

### Orus (Automatic Optimization)
```orus
// Orus automatic optimization
for outer in 1..1001:
    for i in 1..5:  // Automatically unrolled
        mut x = i * 2
        mut y = x + 1
        mut z = y * 3
```

## Performance Analysis

### Why Orus Wins
1. **Compile-time optimization**: No runtime overhead
2. **Perfect unrolling**: Compiler has complete information
3. **Register allocation**: Efficient use of VM registers
4. **Computed goto dispatch**: Optimized instruction dispatch
