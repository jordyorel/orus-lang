# Orus Programming Language

**Orus** is a fast, elegant programming language that brings together the best of modern language design: Python's readability, Rust's safety, and blazing performance from a register-based virtual machine.

---

## 🎯 Why Orus?

### **Performance First**
Built on a register-based VM with computed-goto dispatch, Orus outperforms Python by **7×**, JavaScript by **11×**, and even competes with Lua. No JIT warmup time, just consistent speed.

### **Readable & Expressive**
Clean indentation-based syntax that feels natural. Write less boilerplate, express more meaning:

```orus
fn fibonacci(n: i32) -> i32:
    if n <= 1: 
        n
    else: 
        fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

let result = fibonacci(10)
print("Result: {}", result)
```

### **Safe by Default**
Static typing with intelligent inference. Catch errors at compile time, not runtime:

```orus
let numbers: [i32] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let evens = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]  # Type-safe comprehensions
```

### **Modern Features**
Advanced type inference, functions, and type safety - with pattern matching and generics coming soon:

```orus
fn fibonacci(n: i32) -> i32:
    if n <= 1: 
        n
    else: 
        fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

// Type inference in action
fn add(a, b):  // Types inferred from usage
    a + b

result = add(1, 2)        // Inferred as i32
float_result = add(1.0, 2.0)  // Inferred as f64
```

## 🚀 Language Overview

### **Variables & Types**
```orus
let name = "Alice"           # inferred as string
let age: i32 = 25           # explicit typing
let mut score = 0           # mutable variable
```

### **Control Flow with Advanced Loop Safety**
```orus
if score > 100:
    print("High score!")
elif score > 50:
    print("Good job!")
else:
    print("Keep trying!")

# Advanced range syntax with steps
for i in 0..20..2:
    print("Even number: {}", i)

# Progressive loop safety system
for i in 0..1500000:        # Warns at 1M, continues
    process_data(i)         # Automatic protection against runaway loops
```

### **Structs & Methods**
```orus
struct Player:
    name: string
    health: i32

impl Player:
    fn new(name: string) -> Player:
        Player{ name: name, health: 100 }
    
    fn take_damage(mut self, damage: i32):
        self.health -= damage
```

### **Error Handling**
```orus
try:
    let result = risky_operation()
    print("Success: {}", result)
catch err:
    print("Error: {}", err)
```

## 🧬 Architecture & Performance

### **Register-Based VM**
Unlike stack-based VMs (Python, JavaScript), Orus uses a register architecture that:
- Eliminates stack push/pop overhead
- Enables better instruction-level optimization
- Provides more efficient memory access patterns

### **Advanced Type System**
Sophisticated Hindley-Milner type inference with:
- **Algorithm W implementation** with union-find optimization
- **Arena-based memory management** for type objects
- **Constraint-based solving** with comprehensive error reporting
- **Type variable unification** with occurs check
- **Polymorphic type schemes** for generic programming

### **Computed Goto Dispatch**
```c
// Instead of slow switch statements:
switch (instruction) { case OP_ADD: ...; }

// Orus uses computed goto:
goto *dispatch_table[instruction];
```

### **Type-Aware Compilation**
- **Static type checking** with inference reduces runtime overhead
- **Type-specific opcodes** for optimal performance
- **Compile-time optimizations** based on type information
- **Zero-cost abstractions** for type safety

### **Memory Management**
Mark-and-sweep garbage collector with object pooling, automatic memory reclamation, and configurable thresholds for optimal performance.
