# Orus Language Polish Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines identified issues and planned improvements for **existing features** in the Orus programming language. This roadmap focuses purely on polishing, fixing, and enhancing the functionality that is already implemented, not adding new features.

**Status**: Post Phase 3 & 4 Register Architecture Implementation  
**Last Updated**: July 2025  
**Target Audience**: Orus Language Development Team

## Executive Summary

Following the successful implementation of the hierarchical register architecture (Phases 3 & 4), comprehensive testing has revealed several minor issues with existing features that should be addressed to improve the developer experience. While the core language is stable and performant, these polish improvements will enhance usability and quality of the current implementation.

## Issue Classification

### ðŸŸ¢ **Core Strengths (Working Well)**
- âœ… Type system with inference and Phase 5 casting rules
- âœ… Register-based VM with hierarchical architecture
- âœ… Control flow (if/else, while, for loops)
- âœ… Arithmetic and logical operations
- âœ… Variable scoping and shadowing
- âœ… LICM and loop optimizations
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite (132 tests passing)

### ðŸŸ¡ **Minor Issues (Low Priority)**
- Print statement spacing problems
- Redundant type annotation warnings
- Compiler warnings for unused functions
- Inconsistent documentation


### ðŸ”´ **Architecture Gaps (High Priority)**
- Comprehensive benchmark compilation issues
- Potential memory leaks in new register architecture
- Integration testing gaps

## Timeline and Resources

### Estimated Timeline
- **Phase A (Polish & Quality)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase B (Type Annotations)**: 1 week  
- **Phase C (Testing & Integration)**: 2-3 weeks
- **Phase D (Documentation & Polish)**: 1-2 weeks

**Total Duration**: 6-9 weeks (1.5-2 months)

**Note**: This roadmap focuses on minor issues and polish. Major features like function definitions, module system, and additional numeric types are covered in the separate MISSING.md roadmap.

### Resource Requirements
- **Language Design Team**: 1-2 developers
- **Compiler Team**: 2-3 developers
- **VM Team**: 1-2 developers
- **Testing Team**: 1-2 developers
- **Documentation Team**: 1 developer

### Parallel Development
Many phases can be developed in parallel:
- Phase A can run alongside Phase B
- Module design (C.1) can start during Phase B
- Testing (Phase D) can begin as features complete
- Documentation (Phase E) can be ongoing

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Module System Complexity**: Module implementation may uncover architectural issues
- **Function Integration**: Function calls may conflict with register architecture
- **Performance Impact**: New features may impact existing performance

### Medium Risk
- **Breaking Changes**: Some improvements may require syntax changes
- **Testing Coverage**: Ensuring complete test coverage for new features
- **Timeline Pressure**: Feature interactions may cause delays

### Low Risk
- **Polish Items**: Print formatting and warning cleanup are low risk
- **Documentation**: Documentation updates are straightforward
- **Error Messages**: Error message improvements are isolated changes

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Development**: Implement features incrementally with testing
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain compatibility where possible
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous performance benchmarking
4. **Code Review**: Thorough review process for all changes
5. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for experimental functionality
