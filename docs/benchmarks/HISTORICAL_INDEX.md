## üìä Performance Trends Analysis

### Major Milestones
- **v0.2.2 (July 2025)**: First time achieving overall 1st place across all benchmarks
- **v0.2.2 (July 2025)**: Tail call optimization implementation
- **v0.2.1**: Computed Goto dispatch implementation
- **v0.2.0**: Early optimizations phase

### Benchmark Categories Evolution
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Orus now leads consistently
- **Control Flow**: Maintained leadership with optimizations
- **Function Calls**: NEW category added with tail call optimization

## üîç How to Use This System

### Adding New Benchmark Results
1. Create a new file in `historical/` with format: `YYYY-MM-DD_vX.X.X_feature_name.md`
2. Update this index file with the new entry
3. Update the main `BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md` with latest results only

### File Naming Convention
- Date format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
- Version format: `vX.X.X`
- Feature name: Brief description of main feature (snake_case)
- Example: `2025-07-09_v0.2.2_tail_call_optimization.md`

### Historical File Structure
Each historical benchmark file should include:
- Test configuration and environment
- Complete benchmark results tables
- Performance analysis and key achievements
- Technical implementation details
- Performance trends and comparisons

## üéØ Benefits of This System

### For Developers
- **Track performance regressions** - easily compare across versions
- **Identify optimization impact** - measure specific feature improvements
- **Historical context** - understand performance evolution
- **Debugging aid** - correlate performance changes with code changes

### For Documentation
- **Clean main file** - BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md stays focused on latest results
- **Comprehensive history** - detailed records preserved
- **Easy navigation** - indexed and searchable
- **Performance storytelling** - show progress over time

## üìà Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- **Automated benchmark archiving** - script to generate historical entries
- **Performance regression detection** - automatic alerts for performance drops
- **Benchmark comparison tool** - easy comparison between versions
- **Performance visualization** - charts and graphs for trends
- **CI/CD integration** - automatic benchmarking on releases

---

**Maintenance**: This index should be updated with each new benchmark run that represents a significant milestone or version release.
