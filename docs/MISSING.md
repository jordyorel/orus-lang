# Orus Programming Language ‚Äì Development Roadmap

_Last reviewed: v0.3.0 (September 2025)_

This roadmap tracks the gap between the current Orus implementation and the
next set of language and tooling goals. It consolidates the real state of the
multi-pass typed-AST compiler pipeline, runtime, and diagnostics so new
contributors can immediately see what is finished, what is underway, and what
still needs design work.

---

## üìå Current Snapshot
- ‚úÖ **End-to-end toolchain** ‚Äì Source code flows through the lexer, parser,
  Hindley‚ÄìMilner type inference, the multi-pass typed-AST compiler (optimization
  followed by bytecode generation), and the 256-register VM via `interpret()`
  and `compileProgram()`.
- ‚úÖ **Core language surface** ‚Äì Functions, variables (`mut` + inference),
  arithmetic/logical expressions, conditionals, and `while`/`for` loops execute
  reliably (see `tests/comprehensive/comprehensive_language_test.orus`).
- ‚úÖ **Data model** ‚Äì Strings, booleans, integers (`i32/i64/u32/u64`), doubles,
  and heap-backed arrays (push/pop/slicing/iteration) are fully wired through
  the type system and VM runtime.
- ‚úÖ **Polymorphism** ‚Äì Hindley‚ÄìMilner generalization works for reusable
  functions (e.g., `tests/types/polymorphic_identity.orus`), though first-class
  generic syntax (`fn foo<T>`) is not yet exposed.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Diagnostics** ‚Äì Loop/context validation and scope tracking ship, but the
  planned rich Rust-style error formatter and variable lifecycle diagnostics are
  still pending (`docs/OUTSTANDING_COMPILER_AND_DIAGNOSTICS.md`).
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Module system** ‚Äì Runtime hooks exist (`interpret_module` and module
  loaders), yet the surface syntax and packaging workflow remain to be
  implemented and tested.
- üöß **Pattern matching** ‚Äì Parser groundwork exists for `match` keywords, but
  expression lowering and exhaustiveness checks are still outstanding (see
  TODO below).

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Milestones

### Frontend & Type System
- Full tokenization and indentation-aware parsing for the current language
  syntax, covering functions, control flow, and expressions.
- Hindley‚ÄìMilner inference with constraint solving, explicit annotations, casts,
  numeric literals with suffixes, and polymorphic generalization.
- Typed AST visualization tooling (`--show-typed-ast`) to inspect inference
  results during development.

```orus
fn identity(value):
    return value

print(identity(123))
print(identity(true))
print(identity("orus"))
```

### Compiler & Optimization Pipeline
- `compileProgram()` drives typed AST generation, register allocation, constant
  propagation, and bytecode emission into VM chunks.
- Peephole optimizer deduplicates redundant loads and boolean immediates.
- Jump patching infrastructure and source-location metadata power reliable
  control-flow codegen and diagnostics.
- CI fixtures cover arithmetic, control flow, functions, arrays, strings, and
  polymorphic type behaviour across `tests/`.

### Runtime & Tooling
- 256-register VM with dedicated banks for globals, frames, temporaries, and
  future module imports; dispatch tables ship in both `goto` and `switch`
  variants.
- Built-in printing, string interpolation, numeric formatting, and array
  helpers are available in the runtime (`src/vm/runtime/builtins.c`).
- CLI, REPL, and configuration layers share the same compiler/runtime path and
  expose toggles for bytecode dumps, typed AST, and profiling.

```orus
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
mut total = 0

for n in 0..len(numbers):
    total = total + numbers[n]

print("sum:", total)
```

## üöß Active Work (Q4 2025)
| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Rich error presentation | In progress | Implement the structured renderer from `docs/ERROR_FORMAT_REPORTING.md` across CLI/REPL. |
| Variable lifecycle diagnostics | In progress | Use scope metadata to flag duplicate declarations, use-before-init, and const mutations. |
| Iterator-style `for item in collection` | Design | Parser/codegen support pending; VM array iterators are ready. |
| Module packaging | Design | Module manager + loader stubs exist; surface syntax and tests still missing. |
| Print formatting polish | Backlog | Finish escape handling and numeric formatting for the print APIs. |

---

## üéØ Near-Term Targets
1. Ship the structured diagnostic renderer with regression snapshots.
2. Complete variable lifecycle analysis and wire the results into the feature
   error reporters.
3. Extend the parser/typechecker/codegen to support iterator-style `for` loops
   using array iterators.
4. Define and implement module declarations/import syntax, backed by the
   existing loader.
5. Document and stabilize the printing APIs once formatting is finalized.

---

## üî≠ Deferred & Future Initiatives
- **First-class generics** ‚Äì Parse `<T>` parameters, monomorphize function and
  struct definitions, and enforce trait/constraint checking.

  ```orus
  // Generic functions
  fn identity[T](value: T) -> T:
      value

  // Generic structs
  struct Box[T]:
      value: T

  // Generic constraints
  fn add[T: Numeric](a: T, b: T) -> T:
      a + b

  fn min[T: Comparable](a: T, b: T) -> T:
      a if a < b else b

  fn main():
      count = identity[i32](5)
      greeting: Box[str] = Box{ value: "hi" }
      total = add[i32](10, 20)
      print(count, greeting.value, total)
  ```
- **Standard library** ‚Äì Curate a minimal module set (math, arrays, strings)
  once the module system is stable.
- **Advanced optimizations** ‚Äì Loop-invariant code motion, loop unrolling, and
  strength reduction passes once diagnostics are solid.
- **Performance telemetry** ‚Äì Expand VM profiling to collect per-opcode
  statistics and surface them in tooling.

### Planned Language Constructs
Each of the following surface features is scoped for post-v0.3.0 delivery once
module packaging lands. The intent is to slot them into the existing
multi-pass typed-AST compiler pipeline‚Äîleveraging the typed AST produced by
Hindley‚ÄìMilner inference, the optimization pass, and the bytecode generation
pass‚Äîwithout introducing additional intermediate representations.

1. **Struct definitions** ‚Äì Extend the parser with record literals, allocate
   contiguous register frames for fields, and integrate field access in the
   type checker.

   ```orus
   struct Point:
       x: i32
       y: i32

   fn origin():
       return Point{ x: 0, y: 0 }

   fn shift(p: Point, dx: i32, dy: i32):
       Point{ x: p.x + dx, y: p.y + dy }
   ```

2. **Enum + tagged unions** ‚Äì Model discriminated unions via tagged payloads in
   the VM, add pattern exhaustiveness checks, and reuse Hindley‚ÄìMilner type
   inference to propagate variant data.

   ```orus
   enum Result[T]:
       Ok(value: T)
       Err(message: str)

   fn parse_number(text: str): Result[i32]:
       if text == "":
           return Result.Err("empty input")
       Result.Ok(to_i32(text))
   ```

3. **`impl` blocks and methods** ‚Äì Allow attaching functions to struct/enum
   types, synthesize method receivers as the first parameter, and support
   namespaced lookup during codegen.

   ```orus
   impl Point:
       fn magnitude(self):
           sqrt(self.x * self.x + self.y * self.y)

   fn demo():
       p = Point{ x: 3, y: 4 }
       print(p.magnitude())
   ```

4. **Pattern matching** ‚Äì Provide a `match` expression with exhaustive checking
   for enums, tuples, and primitive guards while compiling each arm into linear
   control flow blocks.

  ```orus
  match parse_number(input):
      Result.Ok(value):
          print("parsed", value)
      Result.Err(msg):
          print("failed:", msg)
  ```

   - [ ] **TODO**: Implement match expressions with destructuring patterns.

     ```orus
     match value:
         0 -> print("zero")
         1 -> print("one")
         _ -> print("other")
     ```

5. **Module system** ‚Äì Finalize module declarations, `use` statements, and
   namespace resolution so compiled bytecode can map to the existing module
   loader API.

   ```orus
   # geometry/points.orus
   pub struct Point:
       x: i32
       y: i32

   pub fn distance(a: Point, b: Point):
       dx = a.x - b.x
       dy = a.y - b.y
       sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy)

   # main.orus
   use geometry.points: Point, distance

   fn main():
       origin = Point{ x: 0, y: 0 }
       target = Point{ x: 3, y: 4 }
       print(distance(origin, target))
   ```
