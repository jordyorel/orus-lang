# Orus Programming Language - Development Roadmap

## 🎯 Vision & Goals
Build a language that combines Python's readability, Rust's safety, and Lua's performance through a register-based VM with static typing and modern features.

---

## 📊 Current Status Assessment

### ✅ **What's Complete**
- **VM Foundation**: Register-based with 256 registers, 100+ opcodes
- **Lexer System**: Full tokenization with all language constructs  
- **Advanced Parser**: Precedence climbing with complex expressions
- **Variable System**: Declarations (`x = 42`) with type inference
- **Memory Management**: Garbage collector with object pooling
- **Build System**: Clean makefile with comprehensive benchmarking
- **Type System**: Advanced Hindley-Milner type inference with arena allocation
- **Function System**: Complete function definitions and calls with type checking
- **Control Flow**: if/else, loops with type-aware scoping
- **String System**: Full string operations with type-safe concatenation
- **Type Coercion**: Automatic and explicit type conversions

### 🔄 **Priority Features to Implement First**
- [ ] Arrays and collections (type system ready)
- [ ] Struct definitions and methods
- [ ] Pattern matching and enums
- [ ] Module system
- [ ] Generic System (complete implementation)
- [ ] Enhanced Error Reporting System
- [ ] File I/O System
- [ ] Standard Library Core
