# Orus Language Refactoring Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap addresses the architectural improvements needed to transform Orus from a proof-of-concept into a production-ready language implementation. The refactoring focuses on four key areas identified in the codebase analysis:

1. **Global State Reduction** - Eliminate excessive global variables
2. **Function Decomposition** - Break down overly long functions
3. **Configurability Enhancement** - Add runtime and build-time configuration
4. **Unit Testing Infrastructure** - Enable component-level testing

## Current State Assessment

- **Grade**: B+ (Very good organization with room for improvement)
- **Strengths**: Solid foundation, comprehensive integration tests, good performance
- **Critical Issues**: Too much global state, functions too long, limited configurability, hard to unit test

## Phase 1: Global State Reduction (Priority: CRITICAL)

### 1.2 Lexer State Refactoring ✅ COMPLETED
**Target**: `src/compiler/lexer.c` (Line 27)

- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained (all existing APIs preserved)
- ✅ 100% test success rate (70/70 tests passing)

### 1.3 Type System State Refactoring ✅ COMPLETED
**Target**: `src/type/type_representation.c` (Lines 17-21)
**Current Issues**:

## Phase 2: Function Decomposition (Priority: HIGH)

### 2.1 VM Dispatch System Refactoring ✅ COMPLETED
**Target**: `src/vm/dispatch/vm_dispatch_*.c` (~2,100 lines each)
**Current Issues**:
- Massive functions containing entire VM execution
- Difficult to debug and maintain
- Code duplication between goto/switch versions

**Tasks**:
- [x] Create opcode handler functions
- [x] Extract arithmetic operations
- [x] Extract memory operations  
- [x] Extract control flow operations
- [x] Refactor dispatch loop to use handlers
- [x] Eliminate code duplication

**Completed Impact**:
- ✅ Dramatically improved maintainability (handlers organized in separate files)
- ✅ Enabled opcode-specific testing (handlers can be tested independently)
- ✅ Eliminated code duplication (both dispatchers use identical handlers)
- ✅ Better debugging capabilities (isolated handler functions)
- ✅ Zero performance loss (19.4ms avg, ranked #2 in benchmarks)
- ✅ Enhanced architecture with zero-cost abstractions

**Implementation Details**:
- ✅ **Handler Structure**: Created three handler files:
  - `src/vm/handlers/vm_arithmetic_handlers.c` - All arithmetic operations
  - `src/vm/handlers/vm_memory_handlers.c` - Memory & I/O operations
  - `src/vm/handlers/vm_control_flow_handlers.c` - Control flow operations
- ✅ **Zero-Cost Abstraction**: All handlers are `static inline` functions
- ✅ **Unified API**: Both switch and goto dispatchers use identical handler calls
- ✅ **Maintained Behavior**: All 70 tests pass with exact same functionality
- ✅ **Performance Preservation**: Benchmarks show no regression (vs Python: 1.72x, vs JavaScript: 2.27x)

### 2.2 Compiler Expression Handling ✅ COMPLETED
**Target**: `src/compiler/compiler.c` `compileExpr()` (29 lines) and `compileCast()` (265 lines → 33 lines)
**Current Issues**:
- ✅ Single function handling all expression types (already well-structured)
- ✅ Complex type conversion logic embedded (resolved)

**Tasks**:
- [x] Extract literal compilation handlers (already modular)

- [x] Create expression-specific handlers (comprehensive cast handlers implemented)

**Completed Impact**:
- ✅ Dramatically improved code organization (6 specialized cast handlers)
- ✅ Better testing granularity (type-specific handler testing enabled)
- ✅ Easier maintenance (265-line function reduced to 33 lines)
- ✅ Zero functionality loss (all 70 tests passing)
- ✅ Enhanced modularity (each source type has dedicated handler)

### 2.3 Parser Expression Handling
**Target**: `src/compiler/parser.c` `parsePrimaryExpression()` (259 lines)
**Current Issues**:
